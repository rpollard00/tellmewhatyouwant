                <p>If you send me (a millenial) a chat message. You can just get straight to the point.</p>

                    Please, just tell me what you want. You don't have to say hello...
                    but you can if it makes you feel better.
                </p>
                <p>Just follow it up with what you might actually need help with.</p>
                <p>You'll probably get what you want faster. I am busy, but maybe I can pause what I'm doing to help you.</p>
                <p>But I don't actually know until you TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.</p>
                <p>Believe it or not, I can't keep every single thing I've ever worked on in my head. If you tell me what you want, I can look it up, and then if we do need to discuss it on the phone I will be more prepared to help you.</p>

                <li>This is 100% serious. It is VERY annoying when you send a message with no context and then wait for a response.</li>
